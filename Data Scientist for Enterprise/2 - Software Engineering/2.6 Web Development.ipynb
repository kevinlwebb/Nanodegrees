    "As another example, consider a system that recommends movies based on a user's preferences. Part of the recommendation engine could include a web application that displays recommended products based on a userid. What you learn in this course will set you up for building the web app portion of the recommendation engine."

    "\n",
    "## CSS and this Lesson\n",
    "To build the data dashboard at the end of this lesson, you won't need to actually write any CSS. Instead, you'll use libraries that take care of the CSS for you. In this that, that would be the Bootstrap library.\n",
    "- https://getbootstrap.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you are interested in understanding what Bootstrap is doing under the hood, then you need to understand how to style a website with CSS. This page has a summary of some important aspects of CSS programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Purpose of CSS?\n",
    "In most professional websites, css is kept in a separate stylesheet. This makes it easier to separate content (html) from style (css). Code becomes easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in the history of css and how it came about, here is an interesting link: history of css.\n",
    "- https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS stands for cascading style sheets. The \"cascading\" refers to how rules trickle down to the various layers of an html tree. For example, you might specify that all paragraphs have the same font type. But then you want to override one of the paragraphs to have a different font type. How does a browser decide which rules apply when there is a conflict? That's based on the cascade over. You can read more about that here.\n",
    "- https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-cascade-mean-3466872\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different ways to write CSS\n",
    "As discussed in the video, there are essentially two ways to write CSS: inline or with a stylesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline means that you specify the CSS directly inside of an html tag like so:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, you can put the CSS in a stylesheet. The stylesheet can go underneath an html head tag like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "   <style>\n",
    "       p {font-size: 20px;}\n",
    "   </style>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or the css can go into its own separate css file (extension .css). Then you can link to the css file within the html head tag like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\">\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "where style.css is the path to the style.css file. Inside the style.css file would be the style rules such as\n",
    "```html\n",
    "p {\n",
    "  color:red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSS Rules and Syntax\n",
    "CSS is essentially a set of rules that you can use to stylize html. The W3 Schools CSS Website is a good place to find all the different rules you can use. These including styling text, links, margins, padding, image, icons and background colors among other options.\n",
    "- https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax is that you:\n",
    "1. select the html element, id, and/or class of interest\n",
    "2. specify what you want to change about the element\n",
    "3. specify a value, followed by a semi-colon\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "```html\n",
    "a {\n",
    "  text-decoration:none;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "where a is the element of interest, text-decoration is what you want to change, and none is the value. You can write multiple rules within one set of brackets like:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "a {\n",
    "  text-decoration:none;\n",
    "  color:blue;\n",
    "  font-weight:bold;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also select elements by their class or id.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select by class name, you use a dot like so:\n",
    "```html\n",
    ".class_name {\n",
    "   color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To select by id name, you use the pound sign:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "#id_name {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can make more complex selections as well like \"select paragraphs inside the div with id \"div_top\" . If your html looks like this,\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"div_top\">\n",
    "   <p>This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "then the CSS would be like this:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "div#div_top p {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Margins and Padding\n",
    "The difference between margin and padding is a bit tricky. Margin rules specify a spatial buffer on the outside of an element. Padding specifies an internal spatial buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples below show how this works. They use a div element with a border. Here is the div without any margin or padding:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"border:solid red 1px;\">\n",
    "    Box\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Margin\n",
    "In this case, the div has a margin of 40 pixels. This creates a spatial buffer on the outside of the div element.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"border:solid red 1px;margin:40px;\">\n",
    "    Box\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding\n",
    "This next case has a padding of 40px. In the case of padding, the spatial buffer is internal.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"border:solid red 1px;padding:40px;\">\n",
    "    Box\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Margin and Padding\n",
    "In this case, the div element has both a margin of 40 pixels and a padding of 40 pixels.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div style=\"border:solid red 1px;margin:40px;padding:40px;\">\n",
    "    Box\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying Size: Pixels versus Percent versus EM Units\n",
    "In CSS there are various ways to define sizes, widths, and heights. The three main ones are pixels, percentages, and em units.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use px, you're defining the exact number of pixels an element should use in terms of size. So\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "means the font-size will be exactly 12 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The percent and em units have a similar function. They dynamically change sizing based on a browser's default values. For example\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 100%\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "means to use the default browser font size. 150% would be 1.5 times the default font size. 50% would be half. Similarly, 1em unit would be 1 x default_font. So 2em would be 2 x default font, etc. The advantage of using percents and em is that your web pages become dynamic. The document adapts to the default settings of whatever device someone is using be that a desktop, laptop or mobile phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, percentages and em units are actually calculating sizes relative to parent elements in the html tree. For example, if you specify a font size in a body tag , then the percentages will be relative to the body element:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<body style=\"font-size: 20px\">\n",
    "    <p style=\"font-size:80%\">This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "...\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because different browsers might render html and CSS differently, there isn't necessarily a right or wrong way to specify sizes. This will depend on who will use your website and on what type of devices. You can read more here. You won't need to worry about all of this because in the web app, you're going to use a CSS framework that takes care of all of this for you.\n",

    "## JavaScript and this Lesson\n",
    "To build the data dashboard at the end of this lesson, you won't need to write any JavaScript at all. That's because you'll use libraries (Bootstrap and Plotly) that take care of the JavaScript for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't need to get into the details of JavaScript syntax, but it's good to have at least an idea of what is happening under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JavaScript?\n",
    "- JavaScript is a high level language like Python, PHP, Ruby, and C++. It was specifically developed to make the front-end of a web application more dynamic; however, you can also use javascript to program the back-end of a website with the JavaScript runtime environment node.\n",
    "  - https://nodejs.org/en/\n",
    "- Java and javaScript are two completely different languages that happen to have similar names.\n",
    "- JavaScript syntax, especially for front-end web development, is a bit tricky. It's much easier to write front-end JavaScript code using a framework such as jQuery.\n",
    "  - http://api.jquery.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic JavaScript Syntax\n",
    "Here are a few rules to keep in mind when writing JavaScript:\n",
    "- a line of code ends with a semi-colon ;\n",
    "- () parenthesis are used when calling a function much like in Python\n",
    "- {} curly braces surround large chunks of code or are used when initializing dictionaries\n",
    "- [] square brackets are used for accessing values from arrays or dictionaries much like in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a JavaScript function that sums the elements of an array.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function addValues(x) {\n",
    "  var sum_array = 0;\n",
    "  for (var i=0; i < x.length; i++) {   \n",
    "    sum_array += x[i];\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  return sum_array;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "addValues([3,4,5,6]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is jQuery?\n",
    "Jquery is a JavaScript library that makes developing the front-end easier. JavaScript specifically helps with manipulating html elements. The reason we are showing you Jquery is because the Bootstrap library you'll be using depends on Jquery. But you won't need to write any Jquery yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a link to the documentation of the core functions in jquery: jQuery API documentation\n",
    "- https://api.jquery.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Jquery came out in 2006. There are newer JavaScript tools out there like React and Angular.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you probably won't need to use any of these tools. But if you work in a startup environment, you'll most likely hear front-end engineers talking about these tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## jQuery Syntax\n",
    "The jQuery library simplifies JavaScript quite a bit. Compare the syntax. Compare these two examples from the video for changing the h1 title element when clicking on the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is pure JavaScript code for changing the words in the h1 title element.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "        function headFunction() {\n",
    "            document.getElementsByTagName(\"h1\")[0].innerHTML = \n",
    "                  \"A Photo of a Breathtaking View\";\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code searches the html document for all h1 tags, grabs the first h1 tag in the array of h1 tags, and then changes the html. Note that the above code is only the function. You'd also have to add an onClick action in the image html tag like so:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<img src=\"image.jpg\" onclick=\"headFunction()\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "The jQuery code is more intuitive. Once the document has loaded, the following code adds an onclick event to the image. Once the image is clicked, the h1 tag's text is changed.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "         $(document).ready(function(){\n",
    "            $(\"img\").click(function(){\n",
    "                $(\"h1\").text(\"A Photo of a Breathtaking View\");\n",
    "            });\n",
    "        });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The dollar sign $ is jQuery syntax that says \"grab this element, class or id\". That part of the syntax should remind you somewhat of CSS. For example $(\"p#first\") means find the paragraph with id=\"first\". Or $(\"#first\") would work as well.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript has something called callback function, which can make learning javascript a bit tricky. Callback functions are essentially functions that can be inputs into other functions. In the above code, there is the ready() function that waits for the html document to load. Then there is another function being passed into the ready function. This section function adds an on-click event to an image tag. Then there's another function passed into the click() function, which changes the h1 text."

    "\n",
    "Because the web app you're developing will have a Python back-end, you can use the Python library to create your charts. Rather than having you learn more JavaScript syntax, you can use the Python syntax that you already know. However, you haven't built a back-end yet, so for now, you'll see the basics of how Plotly works using the JavaScript library. The syntax between the Python and Javascript versions is similar.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is Flask?\n",
    "Flask. A web framework takes care of all the routing needed to organize a web page so that you don't have to write the code yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type \"http://www.udacity.com\" into a browser, your computer sends out a request to another computer (ie the server) where the Udacity website is stored. Then the Udacity server sends you the files needed to render the website in your browser. The Udacity computer is called a server because it \"serves\" you the files that you requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP part of the web address stands for Hypter-text Transfer Protocol. HTTP defines a standard way of sending and receiving messages over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hit enter in your browser, your computer says \"get me the files for the web page at www.udacity.com\": except that message is sent to the server with the syntax governed by HTTP. Then the server sends out the files via the protocol as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There needs to be some software on the server that can interpret these HTTP requests and send out the correct files. That's where a web framework like Flask comes into play. A framework abstracts the code for receiving requests as well as interpreting the requests and sending out the correct files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Flask?\n",
    "- First and foremost, you'll be working with Flask because it is written in Python. You won't need to learn a new programming language.\n",
    "- Flask is also a relatively simple framework, so it's good for making a small web app.\n",
    "- Because Flask is written in Python, you can use Flask with any other Python library including pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. In this lesson, you'll be deploying a data dashboard and pandas will help get the data ready.\n",

    "## Using Flask in the Classroom Workspace\n",
    "In the next part of the lesson, you'll see a classroom workspace. The classroom workspace already has Flask set up for you. So for now, all you need to do to run the Flask app is to open a Terminal and type.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "That assumes you are in the default workspace directory within Terminal. That will get the server running.\n",

    "```\n",
    "This command will return the Linux environmental variables that contain information about your classroom workspace. The `env` command will list all the environmental variables. The `|` symbol is a pipe for sending output from one command to another. The `grep` command searches text, so `grep WORK` will search for any text containing the word WORK.\n",

    "## Creating New Pages\n",
    "To create a new web page, you first need to specify the route in the routes.py as well as the name of the html template.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/new-route')\n",

    "The route name, function name, and template name do not have to match; however, it's good practice to make them similar so that the code is easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new_route.html file must go in the templates folder. Flask automatically looks for html files in the templates folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is @app.route?\n",
    "To use Flask, you don't necessarily need to know what @app.route is doing. You only have to remember that the path you place inside of @app.route() will be the web address. And then the function you write below @app.route is used to render the correct html template file for the web address.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the @ symbol is used for decorators. Decorators are a shorthand way to input a function into another function. Take a look at this code. Python allows you to use a function as an input to another function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decorator(input_function):\n",
    "\n",
    "    return input_function\n",
    "\n",
    "def input_function():\n",

The goal of these next few videos is to show you how the web template works, which you'll be using later in the final exercise.\n",

The web template you'll be using at the end of the lesson will already provide the code for sharing information between the back and front ends. Your task will be to wrangle data and set up the plotly visualizations using Python. But it's important to get a sense for how the web app works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video above, the data set was sent from the back end to the front end. This was accomplished by including a variable in the render_template() function like so:\n",

    "def index():\n",
    "   return render_template('index.html', data_set = data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this code does is to first load the data using the data_wrangling function from wrangling.py. This data gets stored in a variable called data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In render_template, that data is sent to the front end via a variable called data_set. Now the data is available to the front_end in the data_set variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the index.html file, you can access the data_set variable using the following syntax:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{{ data_set }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can do this because Flask comes with a template engine called Jinja. Jinja also allows you to put control flow statements in your html using the following syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{% for tuple in data_set %}\n",
    "  <p>{{tuple}}</p>\n",
    "{% end_for %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Wrangle data in a file (aka Python module). In this case, the file is called wrangling.py. The wrangling.py has a function that returns the clean data.\n",
    "2. Execute this function in routes.py to get the data in routes.py\n",
    "3. Pass the data to the front-end (index.html file) using the render_template method.\n",

You would read the data, wrangle the data, and then create the plots all using JavaScript; however, to do all of this in JavaScript, you'd need to learn more about JavaScript programming.
