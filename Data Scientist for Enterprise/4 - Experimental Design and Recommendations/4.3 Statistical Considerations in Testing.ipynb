    "This lesson assumes that you already know about basic inferential statistics. In particular, you should know how to perform a statistical test for the difference in means between two groups, and for comparing the mean of a single group against a reference value. Use the workspace below to check your knowledge and as a review.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice: Statistical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment has been designed to have a cookie-based diversion, and we record two things from each user: which page version they received, and whether or not they accessed the download page during the data recording period. (We aren't keeping track of any other factors in this example, such as number of pageviews, or time between accessing the page and making the download, that might be of further interest.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective in this notebook is to perform a statistical test on both recorded metrics to see if there is a statistical difference between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, the 'condition' column takes a 0 for the control group, and 1 for the experimental group. The 'click' column takes a values of 0 for no click, and 1 for a click.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking the Invariant Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we should check that the number of visitors assigned to each group is similar. It's important to check the invariant metrics as a prerequisite so that our inferences on the evaluation metrics are founded on solid ground. If we find that the two groups are imbalanced on the invariant metric, then this will require us to look carefully at how the visitors were split so that any sources of bias are accounted for. It's possible that a statistically significant difference in an invariant metric will require us to revise random assignment procedures and re-do data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we want to do a **two-sided hypothesis test** on the proportion of visitors assigned to one of our conditions. Choosing the control or the experimental condition doesn't matter: you'll get the same result either way. Feel free to use whatever method you'd like: we'll highlight two main avenues below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to take a simulation-based approach, you can simulate the number of visitors that would be assigned to each group for the number of total observations, assuming that we have an expected 50/50 split. Do this many times (200 000 repetitions should provide a good speed-variability balance in this case) and then see in how many simulated cases we get as extreme or more extreme a deviation from 50/50 that we actually observed. Don't forget that, since we have a two-sided test, an extreme case also includes values on the opposite side of 50/50. (e.g. Since simulated outcomes of .48 and lower are considered as being more extreme than an actual observation of 0.48, so too will simulated outcomes of .52 and higher.) The proportion of flagged simulation outcomes gives us a p-value on which to assess our observed proportion. We hope to see a larger p-value, insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to take an analytic approach, you could use the exact binomial distribution to compute a p-value for the test. The more usual approach, however, is to use the normal distribution approximation. Recall that this is possible thanks to our large sample size and the central limit theorem. To get a precise p-value, you should also perform a \n",
    "continuity correction, either adding or subtracting 0.5 to the total count before computing the area underneath the curve. (e.g. If we had 415 / 850 assigned to the control group, then the normal approximation would take the area to the left of $(415 + 0.5) / 850 = 0.489$ and to the right of $(435 - 0.5) / 850 = 0.511$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking the Evaluation Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing our checks on the invariant metric, we can move on to performing a hypothesis test on the evaluation metric: **the click-through rate**. In this case, we want to see that the experimental group has a significantly larger click-through rate than the control group, a one-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation approach for this metric isn't too different from the approach for the invariant metric. You'll need the overall click-through rate as the common proportion to draw simulated values from for each group. You may also want to perform more simulations since there's higher variance for this test.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few analytic approaches possible here, but you'll probably make use of the normal approximation again in these cases. In addition to the pooled click-through rate, you'll need a pooled standard deviation in order to compute a z-score. While there is a continuity correction possible in this case as well, it's much more conservative than the p-value that a simulation will usually imply. Computing the z-score and resulting p-value without a continuity correction should be closer to the simulation's outcomes, though slightly more optimistic about there being a statistical difference between groups."

    "Even if an experiment result shows a statistically significant difference in an evaluation metric between control and experimental groups, that does not necessarily mean that the experiment was a success. If there are any costs associated with deploying a change, those costs might outweigh the benefits expected based on the experiment results. **Practical significance** refers to the level of effect that you need to observe in order for the experiment to be called a true success and implemented in truth. Not all experiments imply a practical significance boundary, but it's an important factor in the interpretation of outcomes where it is relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you consider the confidence interval for an evaluation metric statistic against the null baseline and practical significance bound, there are a few cases that can come about.\n",

    "### Confidence interval is fully in practical significance region\n",
    "(Below, $m_0$ indicates the null statistic value, $d_{min}$ the practical significance bound, and the blue line the confidence interval for the observed statistic. We assume that we're looking for a positive change, ignoring the negative equivalent for $d_{min}$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the confidence interval for the statistic does not include the null or the practical significance level, then the experimental manipulation can be concluded to have a statistically and practically significant effect. It is clearest in this case that the manipulation should be implemented as a success.\n",

    "###  Confidence interval completely excludes any part of practical significance region\n",
    "\n",
    "If the confidence interval does not include any values that would be considered practically significant, this is a clear case for us to not implement the experimental change. This includes the case where the metric is statistically significant, but whose interval does not extend past the practical significance bounds. With such a low chance of practical significance being achieved on the metric, we should be wary of implementing the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Confidence interval includes points both inside and outside practical significance bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves the trickiest cases to consider, where the confidence interval straddles the practical significance bound. In each of these cases, there is an uncertain possibility of practical significance being achieved. In an ideal world, you would be able to collect more data to reduce our uncertainty, reducing the scenario to one of the previous cases. Outside of this, you'll need to consider the risks carefully in order to make a recommendation on whether or not to follow through with a tested change. Your analysis might also reveal subsets of the population or aspects of the manipulation that do work, in order to refine further studies or experiments."

Remember that the variance of the difference distribution is the sum of the variances for the individual distributions, and that _each_ group is assigned `n` observations.\n",
    "  - `null_dist`: To assist in re-use, this should be a [scipy norm object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html). Specify the center and standard deviation of the normal distribution using the \"loc\" and \"scale\" arguments, respectively.\n",
    "  - `p_crit`: Compute the critical value of the distribution that would cause us to reject the null hypothesis. One of the methods of the `null_dist` object will help you obtain this value (passing in some function of our desired error rate `alpha`).\n",
    "2. The power is the proportion of the distribution under the alternative hypothesis that is past that previously-obtained critical value.\n",
    "  - `se_alt`: Now it's time to make computations in the other direction. This will be standard deviation of differences under the desired detectable difference. Note that the individual distributions will have different variances now: one with `p_null` probability of success, and the other with `p_alt` probability of success.\n",
    "  - `alt_dist`: This will be a scipy norm object like above. Be careful of the \"loc\" argument in this one. The way the `power` function is set up, it expects `p_alt` to be greater than `p_null`, for a positive difference.\n",
    "  - `beta`: Beta is the probability of a Type-II error, or the probability of failing to reject the null for a particular non-null state. That means you should make use of `alt_dist` and `p_crit` here!\n",
    "\n",
    "The second half of the function has already been completed for you, which creates a visualization of the distribution of differences for the null case and for the desired detectable difference. Use the cells that follow to run the function and observe the visualizations, and to test your code against a few assertion statements. Check the following page if you need help coming up with the solution.\n",

    "## Method 2: Analytic Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got some intuition for power by using trial and error, we can now approach a closed-form solution for computing a minimum experiment size. The key point to notice is that, for an $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ both < .5, the critical value for determining statistical significance will fall between our null click-through rate and our alternative, desired click-through rate. So, the difference between $p_0$ and $p_1$ can be subdivided into the distance from $p_0$ to the critical value $p^*$ and the distance from $p^*$ to $p_1$.\n",

    "When it comes to designing an experiment, it might be useful to run a dummy test as a predecessor to or as part of that process. In a dummy test, you will implement the same steps that you would in an actual experiment to assign the experimental units into groups. However, the experimental manipulation won't actually be implemented, and the groups will be treated equivalently.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple reasons to run a dummy test. First, a dummy test can expose if there are any errors in the randomization or assignment procedures. A short dummy test can be worth the investment if an invariant metric is found to have a statistically significant difference, or if some other systematic bias is identified, because it can help avoid larger problems down the line. A second reason to run a dummy test is to collect data on metrics' behaviors. If historic data is not enough to predict the outcome of recorded metrics or allow for experiment duration to be computed, then a dummy test can be useful for getting baselines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, performing a dummy test requires an investment of resources, the most important of which is time. If time is of the essence, then you may need to just go ahead with the experiment, keeping an eye on invariant metrics for any trouble. An alternative approach is to perform a hybrid test. In the A/B testing paradigm, this can take the form of an A/A/B test. That is, we split the data into three groups: two control and one experimental. A comparison between control groups can be used to learn about null-environment properties before making inferences on the effect of the experimental manipulation."

    "Up until now, you've been using standard hypothesis tests on means of normal distributions to design and analyze experiments. However, it's possible that you will encounter scenarios where you can't rely on only standard tests. This might be due to uncertainty about the true variability of a metric's distribution, a lack of data to assume normality, or wanting to do inference on a statistic that lacks a standard test. It's useful to know about some **non-parametric tests**, not just as a workaround for cases like this, but also as a second check on your experimental results. The main benefit of non-parametric tests is that they don't rely on many assumptions of the underlying population, and so can be used in a wider range of circumstances compared to standard tests. In this notebook, you'll cover two non-parametric approaches that use resampling of the data to make inferences about distributions and differences."

    "## Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is used to estimate sampling distributions by using the actually collected data to generate new samples that could have been hypothetically collected. In a standard bootstrap, a bootstrapped sample means drawing points from the original data _with replacement_ until we get as many points as there were in the original data. Essentially, we're treating the original data as the population: without making assumptions about the original population distribution, using the original data as a model of the population is the best that we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a lot of bootstrapped samples allows us to estimate the sampling distribution for various statistics on our original data. For example, let's say that we wanted to create a 95% confidence interval for the 90th percentile from a dataset of 5000 data points. (Perhaps we're looking at website load times and want to reduce the worst cases.) Bootstrapping makes this easy to estimate. First of all, we take a bootstrap sample (i.e., draw 5000 points with replacement from the original data), record the 90th percentile, and then repeat this a large number of times, let's say 100 000. From this bunch of bootstrapped 90th percentile estimates, we form our confidence interval by finding the values that capture the central 95% of the estimates (cutting off 2.5% on each tail). Implement this operation in the cells below, using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize some useful variables by storing the number of data points in `n_points` and setting up an empty list for the bootstrapped quantile values in `sample_qs`.\n",
    "- Create a loop for each trial:\n",
    "  - First generate a bootstrap sample by sampling from our data with replacement. ([`random.choice`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) will be useful here.)\n",
    "  - Then, compute the `q`th quantile of the sample and add it to the `sample_qs` list. If you're using NumPy v0.15 or later, you can use the [`quantile`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.quantile.html) function to get the quantile directly with `q`; on v0.14 or earlier, you'll need to put `q` in terms of a percentile and use [`percentile`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.percentile.html) instead.\n",
    "- After gathering the bootstrapped quantiles, find the limits that capture the central `c` proportion of quantiles to form the estimated confidence interval."

    "## Permutation Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The permutation test is a resampling-type test used to compare the values on an outcome variable between two or more groups. In the case of the permutation test, resampling is done on the group labels. The idea here is that, under the null hypothesis, the outcome distribution should be the same for all groups, whether control or experimental. Thus, we can emulate the null by taking all of the data values as a single large group. Applying labels randomly to the data points (while maintaining the original group membership ratios) gives us one simulated outcome from the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest is similar to the sampling approach used in a standard hypothesis test, except that we haven't specified a reference distribution to sample from – we're sampling directly from the data we've collected. After applying the labels randomly to all the data and recording the outcome statistic many times, we compare our actual, observed statistic against the simulated statistics. A p-value is obtained by seeing how many simulated statistic values are as or more extreme than the one actually observed, and a conclusion is then drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try implementing a permutation test in the cells below to test if the 90th percentile of times is statistically significantly smaller for the experimental group, as compared to the control group:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize an empty list to store the difference in sample quantiles as `sample_diffs`.\n",
    "- Create a loop for each trial:\n",
    "  - First generate a permutation sample by randomly shuffling the data point labels. ([`random.permutation`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.permutation.html) will be useful here.)\n",
    "  - Then, compute the `q`th quantile of the data points that have been assigned to each group based on the permuted labels. Append the difference in quantiles to the `sample_diffs` list.\n",
    "- After gathering the quantile differences for permuted samples, compute the observed difference for the actual data. Then, compute a p-value from the number of permuted sample differences that are less than or greater than the observed difference, depending on the desired alternative hypothesis."

    "Up until now, you've been using standard hypothesis tests on means of normal distributions to design and analyze experiments. However, it's possible that you might encounter scenarios where you can't rely on only standard tests. This might be due to uncertainty about the true variability of a metric's distribution, a lack of data to assume normality, or wanting to do inference on a statistic that lacks a standard test. It's useful to know about some **non-parametric tests** not just as a workaround for cases like this, but also as a second check on your experimental results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rank-Sum Test (Mann-Whitney)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank-sum test is fairly different from the two previous approaches. There's no resamplng involved; the test is performed only on the data present. The rank-sum test, also known as the Mann-Whitney U test, is not a test of any particular statistic, like the mean or median. Instead, it's a test of distributions: let's say we draw one value at random from the populations behind each group. The null hypothesis says that there's an equal chance that the larger value is from the first group as the second group; the alternative hypothesis says that there's an unequal chance, which can be specified as one- or two-tailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test this hypothesis, we should look at the data we've collected and see in how many cases values from one group win compared to values in the second. That is, for each data point in the first group, we count how many values in the second group that are smaller than it. (If both values are equal, we count that as a tie, worth +0.5 to the tally.) This number of wins for the first group gives us a value $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that $U$ is approximately normally-distributed, given a large enough sample size. If we have $n_1$ data points in the first group and $n_2$ points in the second, then we have a total of $n_1 n_2$ matchups and an equivalent number of victory points to hand out. Under the null hypothesis, we should expect the number of wins to be evenly distributed between groups, and so the expected wins are $\\mu_U = \\frac{n_1 n_2}{2}$. The variability in the number of wins can be found to be the following equation (assuming no or few ties):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\sigma_U = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_1n_2(n_1+n_2+1)}{12}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These $\\mu_U$ and $\\sigma_U$ values can then be used to compute a standard normal z-score, which generates a p-value. Implement this method of performing the rank-sum test in the cells below!\n",
    "\n",

    "## Sign Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign test also only uses the collected data to compute a test result. It only requires that there be paired values between two groups to compare, and tests whether one group's values tend to be higher than the other's.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sign test, we don't care how large differences are between groups, only which group takes a larger value. So comparisons of 0.21 vs. 0.22 and 0.21 vs. 0.31 are both counted equally as a point in favor of the second group. This makes the sign test a fairly weak test, though also a test that can be applied fairly broadly. It's most useful when we have very few observations to draw from and can't make a good assumption of underlying distribution characteristics. For example, you might use a sign test as an additional check on click rates that have been aggregated on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The count of victories for a particular group can be modeled with the binomial distribution. Under the null hypothesis, it is equally likely that either group has a larger value (in the case of a tie, we ignore the comparison): the binomial distribution's success parameter is $p = 0.5$. Implement the sign test in the function below!\n",

    "If you're tracking multiple evaluation metrics, make sure that you're aware of how the Type I error rates on individual metrics can affect the overall chance of making some kind of Type I error. The simplest case we can consider is if we have _n_ independent evaluation metrics, and that seeing one with a statistically significant result would be enough to call the manipulation a success. In this case, the probability of making at least one Type I error is given by $\\alpha_{over} = 1 - (1-\\alpha_{ind})^n$, illustrated in the below image for individual $\\alpha_{ind} = .05$ and $\\alpha_{ind} = .01$:\n",
    "\n",
    "To protect against this, we need to introduce a correction factor on the individual test error rate so that the overall error rate is at most the desired level. A conservative approach is to divide the overall error rate by the number of metrics tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha_{ind} = \\alpha_{over}/n$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the Bonferroni correction. If we assume independence between metrics, we can do a little bit better with the Šidák correction:\n",

    "In real life, evaluation scenarios are rarely so straightforward. Metrics will likely be correlated in some way, rather than being independent. If a positive correlation exists, then knowing the outcome of one metric will make it more likely for a correlated metric to also point in the same way. In this case, the corrections above will be more conservative than necessary, resulting in an overall error rate smaller than the desired level. (In cases of negative correlation, the true error rate could go either way, depending on the types of tests performed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we might need multiple metrics to show statistical significance to call an experiment a success, or there may be different degrees of success depending on which metrics appear to be moved by the manipulation. One metric may not be enough to make it worth deploying a change tested in an experiment. Reducing the individual error rate will make it harder for a truly significant effect to show up as statistically significant. That is, reducing the Type I error rate will also increase the Type II error rate – another conservative shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there is a small balancing act when it comes to selecting an error-controlling scheme. Being fully conservative with one of the simple corrections above means that you increase the risk of failing to roll out changes that actually have an impact on metrics. Consider the level of dependence between metrics and what results are needed to declare a success to calibrate the right balance in error rates. If you need to see a significant change in all of your metrics to proceed with it, you might not need a correction factor at all. You can also use dummy test results, bootstrapping, and permutation approaches to plan significance thresholds. Finally, don't forget that practical significance can be an all-important quality that overrides other statistical significance findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the main focus of this page has been on interpretation of evaluation metrics, it's worth noting that these cautions also apply to invariant metrics. The more invariant metrics you test, the more likely it will be that some test will show a statistically significant difference even if the groups tested are drawn from equivalent populations. However, it might not be a good idea to apply a correction factor to individual tests since we want to avoid larger issues with interpretation later on. As mentioned previously, a single invariant metric showing a statistically significant difference is not necessarily cause for alarm, but it is something that merits follow-up in case it does have an effect on our analysis."

    "If you peek at the results of an experiment before data collection is complete, and choose to stop early because the test is showing statistical significance, you run the risk of a significant increase in your Type I error rate: believing that your experiment had an effect, when in fact it did not. In this notebook, you'll duplicate the assertions made in the video: namely that for an experiment based off of a single traditional statistical test, doing a single peek halfway through the run-time will increase a base Type I error rate from 5% to about 8.6%.\n",

    "The simulation function below uses a bernoulli / binomial success model for the outcome metric, measuring against a historic baseline. That is, each observation is a single coin flip with success probability \"p\". If we see a number of successes that is unusual for our baseline value of \"p\", then we declare a statistically significant result. We will divide the experiment length into multiple 'blocks', checking the status of the experiment after each block is complete. Our outputs of interest are the proportion of trials that are statistically significant in _any_ test, and the proportion of trials that are statistically significant after _each_ individual block.\n",

    "There are three main steps to filling out the `peeking_sim()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate some data\n",
    " - Compute the number of trials per block. For simplicity, just round up any fractions so that each block has the same number of trials: we might end up with slightly more trials per block than the corresponding function parameter.\n",
    " - Generate a data matrix with the number of successes observed in each block: the number of rows should be the number of simulations and the number of columns the number of blocks. You can do this with a single call to numpy's [`random.binomial`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.binomial.html) function.\n",
    "2. Compute z-scores at each 'peek'\n",
    " - For each row, compute the cumulative number of successes after each 'block' of the experiment using numpy's [`cumsum`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html) function. The result should be a matrix with the same dimensions as the data, but each column cumulatively adds up the values in each row up to that point.\n",
    " - Compute the expected mean and standard deviation for the number of successes after each 'block' of the experiment. Remember that this will be based on the [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) and is centered on the raw counts, rather than proportion of successes. It'll be useful to create a vector with the cumulative sum of trials after each block to facilitate these calculations.\n",
    " - Use the cumulative counts, the expected counts, and the standard deviations, to compute the z-scores for each peek at the experiment.\n",
    "3. Aggregate test outcomes\n",
    " - Compute a critical z-value using the supposed Type I error rate. Use this critical value to flag which of the z-scores would be counted as statistically significant, and which would not.\n",
    " - The proportion of trials that are significant at _any_ test will be the proportion of rows that have at least one flagged value. The proportion of trials that are significant at _each_ block will be the mean number of flagged values in each column; this will be a 1-d array. Return both of these values as the output of the function.\n",

    "## A Multiple Comparisons Approach to Early Peeking\n",
    "\n",
    "The safest way we could deal with performing multiple checks and making poor early stopping decisions is to simply not do it. Once an experiment has been planned and all assignment procedures checked, you should just let the experiment run to completion and just assess the results at the very end. That's not to say that you can't perform early stopping, but it does require additional planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way in which you could solve for multiple peeking is to adjust the significance level of individual tests so that the overall error rate is at its desired level. But applying the Bonferroni or Šidák corrections as shown earlier in the lesson will definitely be too conservative, since we know that there is a correlation in test results between peeks. If we see some simulated run with z-score above the threshold at the halfway point, it's more likely to be above that threshold at the end point, compared to some other simulated run that is not statistically significant at the halfway point. One way in which we can obtain a better significance threshold is through the power of simulation. After performing the same steps 1 and 2 above, we want to find a significance level that would call our desired proportion of simulated tests as statistically significant:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate some data (as above)\n",
    "2. Compute z-scores at each 'peek' (as above)\n",
    "3. Obtain required individual-test error rate\n",
    "  - A run is considered statistically significant if it exceeds the critical bounds at _any_ peek. Obtain the maximum z-score from each row as a worst-case scenario for a null run to be falsely rejected.\n",
    "  - Find the z-score threshold that would reject our desired overall Type I error rate.\n",
    "  - Convert that z-score into an equivalent individual-test error rate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Early Stopping\n",
    "As the above workspace shows, there are significant risks for peeking ahead and making an early decision if it is not planned for in the design. If you haven't accounted for the effects of peeking on your error rate, then it's best to resist the temptation to look at the results early, and only perform a final analysis at the end of the experiment. This is another reason why it's important to design an experiment ahead of any data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are ways of putting together a design to allow for making an early decision on an experiment. In the workspace, we showed how to treat the problem like a multiple comparisons problem, adjusting the individual test-wise error rate to preserve an overall error rate. For continuous tracking, this [page](https://www.evanmiller.org/sequential-ab-testing.html) describes a rule of thumb for rate-based metrics, tracking the number of successes in each group and stopping the experiment once the counts' sum or difference exceeds some threshold. More generally, tests like the [sequential probability ratio test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_probability_ratio_test) can be developed to make an early stopping decision while an experiment is running, if it looks statistically unlikely for a metric to move past or fall back against the statistical significance bound."
